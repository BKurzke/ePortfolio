<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>I am a 35 year old Australian who has worked as a storeperson for the past 15 years.<br> I was born in Victoria, have lived in Tasmania for 11 of my adult years and recently moved to Perth with my partner.<br> I have an interest in music and play guitar. I used to play in a punk rock band in Tasmania however that ended once covid happened.<br> Since selling everything and moving to perth I have found myself with a lot of extra spare time, so I have decided to explore one of my other hobbies which is computers and IT.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have always had an interest in IT and computers from a young age. <br>As a child we always had family computers from Commodore 64, Amiga 500 and eventually a PC. <br>During my teenage years I pretty much self-taught myself how to build a PC and have a pretty detailed knowledge of how operating systems and various software works. <br>During high school I did do Information Technology classes as well as Multimedia and Visual design courses.<br>
I chose to study through RMIT through OUA as I felt I finally might have enough time to consider studying something in my spare time. <br>I have signed up for Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming to test the waters and see if its something I would like to continue with.<br>
I expected the courses to be pretty basic, but have found I am learning a lot of stuff through them and am even finding them challenging, I guess technology has come a long way since I was a student.


<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<h2>IT Support officer</h2>
<img src="images\job.jpg" alt="IT support officer">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The ideal IT job for me would be something like this role as an IT support officer. <br>An IT support officer would be responsible for management and delivery of an IT system or program. <br>I find this appealing as it involves problem solving skills and possibly some creative output in order to meet the employers requirements<br>
The skill requirements for this position are first and foremost a bachelor in IT, experience in hardware and software technical support. It would also require good communication skills and experience working in team environments.<br>
These are all skills I don’t really have as of yet, though I do have a lot of work experience in an unrelated field. I think I could apply some communication and teamwork experience I have learned through being a storeperson over the past 15 years to any field of work I might find myself in in the future.<br>
To gain the skills and qualifications for a position like this I would first need to complete my bachelor in IT. Then I would need some experience in an IT workplace, most likely in a position such as IT support technician.

<h1> Project: In Browser fact checking / Chrome Plugin </h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The internet can be a dangerous source of misinformation. We all know someone who has fallen down a rabbit hole on the internet and possibly started posting about some weird conspiracy theories on their social medias. <br>It is important to protect those we love, especially our children from the misinformation that has spread all over the web. That’s why I think there is a place for a subtle, inoffensive plugin that can offer fact checking information should a user end up on one of these webpages.</p>

<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p>Misinformation and conspiracy theories have reached the mainstream thanks to the internet and probably more importantly social media, where not enough seems to be done to combat the spread of this information. <br>For example, a global survey by the guardian and YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project found that 18% of Australians believe the covid fatality rate had been exaggerated, and 32% of Australians believe that Coronavirus was deliberately created by the Chinese government. (https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/surprisingly-popular-survey-shows-alarming-belief-in-covid-conspiracy-theories) <br>This information is damaging to us as a society and more needs to be done to rectify this.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The product is offered as a free plugin on chromium-based browsers. This allows for easy access on pretty much all popular browsers with a large user base. <br>
The plugin is simple and inobtrusive, by offering something as simple as a hyperlink on flagged words we are guiding the user to read further into the topic before making any uncalculated decisions. <br>
It works by detecting key words in any webpage open in the browser, including social media and then creating a hyperlink for the user to follow for fact checked information on that particular topic. <br>
The hyperlink will offer a direct link to search results for the flagged keyword from websites such as factcheck.org, snopes.com, politifact.com etc. <br>
Clicking the hyperlink provided is completely optional for the user, but we hope that if they are doing research on these topics then it’s existence may encourage them to do some cross referencing before forming their own opinions. <br>
Installing the plugin is as simple as downloading the extension on browsers plugin section / web store. <br>
<b>The plugin works in the background and has some customisations: </b><br>
<ul>
<li>The default search engine is fully customisable by the user, and they can change which is the default based on their interests.</li>
<li>Passwords can be applied for enabling or disabling the plugin or editing the default search engine. This is a great option for parents so they know their children or other users aren’t disabling the function.</li>
<li>There will also be a donation link for users if they enjoy their experience. This can help provide improvements and updates to the plugin and make sure the keywords continue to be updated based on current trends. It will also help provide an inobtrusive ad-free experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to not twist the users’ arms and let them feel like they are doing their own research. In order to curve the global trend towards misinformation and conspiracy theories it is important that a careful approach is taken. Were we to just outright ban websites with false or misleading information then the people who read and believe in it would cry foul about censorship or their freedoms taken away.</p>

<h2> Tools and Technologies </h2>
<p>HTML and CSS editing software would be beneficial for writing the code for this plugin<br>
From an aesthetic sense maybe some visual design software would be useful for creating an image/s for the plugin icon and menu interface, but I feel for this particular program less is more as we want to be inobtrusive.<br>
an Email address as well as an application such as Microsoft outlook to try and form partnerships or discuss legalities with the owners of the fact checking websites</p>

<h2> Skills Required </h2>
<p>HTML and CSS skills are essential for writing the code for the plugin which is the backbone of the project<br>
Visual Design skills with a program such as photoshop in order to create a good, minimalist and appealing aesthetic design for the project. </p>

<h2> Outcome </h2>
<p>Should the project be successful, I believe we could see a decrease in the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation through websites, forums and social medias.<br> Hopefully the adoption of the plugin would grow as more and more people use it and recommend to others.<br> Whilst I think it is impossible to completely eliminate misinformation, we can at the very least take preventative measures and encourage people to do further reading before making their decisions. </p>
